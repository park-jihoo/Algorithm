<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/">516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr>Can you solve this real interview question? Longest Palindromic Subsequence - Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".


Example 2:


Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".


 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 * s consists only of lowercase English letters.
