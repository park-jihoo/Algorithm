<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/">129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr>Can you solve this real interview question? Sum Root to Leaf Numbers - You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

 * For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.

Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num2tree.jpg]


Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.


 

Constraints:

 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 9
 * The depth of the tree will not exceed 10.
